## Deviations from OpenClaw

IronClaw intentionally differs from OpenClaw in these ways:

1. **Rust vs TypeScript**: Native performance, memory safety, single binary distribution
2. **WASM sandbox vs Docker**: Lighter weight, faster startup, capability-based security
3. **PostgreSQL + libSQL vs SQLite**: Dual-backend (production PG + embedded libSQL for zero-dep local mode)
4. **NEAR AI focus**: Primary provider with session-based auth
5. **No mobile/desktop apps**: Focus on server-side and CLI initially
6. **WASM channels**: Novel extension mechanism not in OpenClaw
7. **Tinfoil private inference**: IronClaw-only provider for private/encrypted inference
8. **GitHub WASM tool**: Native GitHub integration as WASM tool
9. **Prompt-based skills**: Different approach than OpenClaw capability bundles (trust gating, attenuation)

These are intentional architectural choices, not gaps to be filled.
